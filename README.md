# Rhapsody's Storyteller
This is a very simple, hopefully lightweight application for telling short, linear stories in an RPG-esque style.

Mainly created so I could have a visual version of a dream I had. And also because I'm crazy like that.

## Important notes:
- This engine runs at a static 320x180, though it is designed to scale that as best as it can to the current window size.
